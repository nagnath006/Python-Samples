Exploratory Software Testing

0 That the existence of planets orbiting distant stars (so called extrasolar
planets or exoplanets) has been theorized at least since Isaac Newton
hypothesized the possibility in 1713.2 Various astronomers have used
exoplanets to explain rotational anomalies in various stars, including
Peter van de Karnp in 1969, who explained wobbles in the motion of
Barnard’s star by the presence of a planet 1.6 times the mass of Jupiter.
However, all of this was speculation until 2003, when the first actual
exoplanet was confirmed. The difference wasn’t new science but the
use of software to advance and aid existing science. It was only after the
software-assisted invention of ultrasensitive instruments and the use of
software to analyze the data they return that such accuracy became pos-
sible. By 2006, only 3 years later, more than 200 exoplanets had been
discovered, and more than 300 exoplanets have been confirmed as of
this writing.3
It’s hard to imagine that the instruments necessary to perform such a
search would be possible without software, which played a role not
only in the design and use of the instruments themselves but also in the
analysis of the data they produce. And now, thanks again to software,
the universe is as close as your home computer, vastly increasing the
number of eyes looking for exoplanets. If an earthlike exoplanet is ever
found, you may rest assured that the magic of software will be central
to its discovery and confirmation.

0 That the ability for the autistic to communicate has long been a subject
of argument, with many experts arguing against parents and caregivers
who claim to understand their charges. Is the meaning of what seem to
be random and uncontrollable body movements simply in a language
that the nonautistic cannot translate? Could the power of software
bridge this gap?

For example, a YouTube video4 was produced by a “severely” autistic
girl using specialized software and input / output devices that allowed
her to translate her body language into English. I think Arthur C.
Clarke himself would have been pleased at this most astounding and
humanizing bit of technological magic.

I could cite many more such cases, and even a cursory look at the world
around us would bear witness to many more. The rapid societal, technolog-
ical, and cultural changes of the past 50 years dwarf any such change in any
other period of human existence. Certainly war, radio, television, and the
automobile have had their effect on our society, but now all those also fall
under the domain of software, for war is waged with software-driven tech-
nology, and all of our most sophisticated inventions have been made more
so by software. The more software a device contains, the more it is indistin—
guishable from magic.
